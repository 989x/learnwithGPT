  );
};

export default BlogPost;
```

In this example, we're using the Head component from Next.js to specify the page title, meta description, and meta keywords for the blog post. These elements are critical for SEO as they help search engines understand what your page is about and determine its relevance to users' search queries. The body of the page consists of an H1 heading, introductory paragraph, two H2 headings, and two lists of tips for buying and selling property.

### üôéüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üí¨ Are you sure the code above will work for seo?

Yes, the code above will help with SEO by providing search engines with important information about the content of the page through the use of the Head component. By including a title, meta description, and meta keywords, you are giving search engines information that they can use to understand the topic of the page and determine its relevance to user search queries.

That being said, this is just a starting point for optimizing the page for SEO. There are many other factors that can impact a page's ranking in search results, such as the quality and relevance of the content, the structure of the site, and the presence of backlinks from other sites. To fully optimize a page for SEO, it's important to continuously monitor and adjust your strategies based on the results you see.
